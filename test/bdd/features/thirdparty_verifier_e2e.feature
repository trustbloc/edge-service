Feature: Verifier verifiable credentials and presentations in third party endpoints

  @verify_credentials
  Scenario Outline: Verify credentials using thirdparty verifier endpoints
    Given "Alice" has her "<credential>" issued as verifiable credential using "<did>" and "<private key>"
    Then  "<verifier>" verifies the verifiable credential provided by "Alice"
    Examples:

      | credential                   | verifier                                                                  | did                                                              | private key                                                                              |
